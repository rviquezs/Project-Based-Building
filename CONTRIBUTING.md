### **Contribution Guidelines**

Before making a pull request, please ensure the following:

- **Tutorial Uniqueness**: The tutorial(s) you want to add do not already exist in the repository.
- **Correct Placement**: Your tutorial is correctly placed under the appropriate language/technology section.
- **Improvement of Existing Tutorials**: Contributions to improve existing tutorials are encouraged.
- **Descriptive PR Title**: The pull request needs to have a clear and descriptive title.
- **New Languages/Technologies**: If the language/technology of your tutorial does not exist, feel free to create a new entry in the Table of Contents.
- **Separate PRs**: Make a separate pull request for each tutorial you add or improve.
- **Format**:
    - Use the format `[Title](link_to_tutorial)` for single tutorials.
    - For multi-part series, use the following format:
    ```markdown
    * Title
        * [Part 1](link_to_part_1)
        * [Part 2](link_to_part_2)
    ```
- **Spelling and Grammar**: Please check the spelling and grammar of your tutorial before submitting.
- **Commit Quality**: Do the work, write meaningful commit messages, and ensure that your commits are clear and concise.
- **Whitespace**: Remove any unnecessary trailing whitespaces in your changes.
- **Links**: Ensure that links point directly to the tutorials, without using URL shorteners. If the URL is too long (more than 80 characters), using a Google URL shortener is allowed.
